  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements (REQ-30, REQ-31, REQ-32, REQ-33). The LoginButton component was simplified to remove admin redirect logic, the Navigation component no longer includes Admin links, and the Admin page now embeds authentication UI for unauthenticated users while displaying appropriate content based on authentication and admin status. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the code changes.",
