All requested pages (Home, About, Course/Syllabus, Join/Discord, VIP, Privacy, Contact) have been created with their specified content. Site-wide navigation and footer components are present. The backend includes contact form functionality. Testimonials and FAQ sections are implemented. The design uses a cohesive Go-themed color palette with Tailwind CSS and React/TypeScript as specified.",
