  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all 7 admin panel requirements (REQ-17 through REQ-23). The /admin route is accessible only to authenticated admins, with a dashboard featuring tabs for course editing, announcements, lessons, VIP management, and member viewing. Backend stores and manages all data types (course units, announcements, lessons, VIP memberships, members) with proper admin-only access control. React Query is used throughout for data fetching and mutations. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",

This functionality was not requested in the BuildRequest and appears to be infrastructure for an admin authentication system beyond the specified Internet Identity requirement.",
