# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy GoCode Zone to production on the Internet Computer mainnet.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the application to the Internet Computer mainnet with a production URL
- Ensure all existing pages (Home, About, Course, Join Discord, VIP, Privacy Policy, Contact) are accessible and functional
- Verify contact form backend persistence works in production
- Test Discord invite links and navigation in the live environment

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access GoCode Zone via a public production URL on the Internet Computer, browse all pages, submit contact forms, and join the Discord community.
